# Eklipse Data Scientist – Premium Member Churn Prediction Model 

<h3> Problem Statement: </h3>
In Eklipse, users can purchase premium subscriptions which give the users a lot of
benefits compared to the free version. Premium users can cancel their subscriptions
at any time. We are trying to understand whether a premium user is going to churn
(cancel a subscription) in several days to come.
<h3> Objective:</h3>
Explore the data and build a model to predict whether Eklipse premium users will
churn in the next 7 days.
The results should be presented in a comprehensible manner, good visualization is
highly appreciated. Please state any assumption you’d make and explain any insight
or conclusion that you derive.
<h3>Dataset Description: </h3>
You will be provided with a dataset containing historical data on premium users'
behaviors over the past 7 days. Each row represents the data of one premium user.
